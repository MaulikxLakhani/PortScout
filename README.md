# PortScout - High Performance Port Scanner

## ðŸ“œ Description

PortScout is a fast and efficient network port scanner for common ports. This script performs rapid-fast scanning of supplied IP addresses and domain names to check common ports. While conducting a targeted security audit, PortScout provides the critical information you need to keep your systems secure. Ideally, it takes 2 minutes to scan 100 domains/IPs.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Multi-threading**: Uses threading for concurrent checks, significantly reducing scan times.
- **Port Check**: Identifies open ports and provides service name.
- **Banner Retrieval**: Efficiently retrieves SSH, HTTP banners without authentication.
- - **Detailed Output**: Provides clear output summarizing scan result.

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
python PortScout.py <targets>
```

### Examples

#### Single domain or IP

```bash
python PortScout.py -d 192.168.1.1
```

#### Multiple domains and IPs

```bash
python PortScout.py -d 91.191.200.30 proxy.domain.com
```

#### List of targets via a text file

```bash
python PortScout.py -t targets.txt
```

## Output

The script will provide a summary of the scanned targets:
```
+--------------+------+--------+---------+-----------------------+
|  IP Address  | Port | Status | Service |        Banner         |
+--------------+------+--------+---------+-----------------------+
